Projects using Deep Learning Techniques
•	Implemented a compact Siamese Network for building a speaker verification system to confirm whether the speech signal is from the authorized speaker. Hence, translated a multi-class classification problem into a binary classification problem.
•	The model was trained on GCP VM instance with approx. 3K signal pairs for 50 distinct speakers.
